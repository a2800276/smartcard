This document details changes in the API from the base version of PCSC

* moved 'original' wrapped classes to Smartcard::PCSC::FFI:: module
* Context and Card in Smartcard::PCSC inherit from FFI modules and provide reasonable 
  default paremters where approritate

* Assumptions regarding "reasonable" defaults:
	* reader_name 	-> defaults to first returned by list_readers
	* scope 	-> SCOPE_SYSTEM
	* share		-> SHARE_EXCLUSIVE
	* pref_protocol -> PROTOCOL_ANY
	* disposition(for disconnect) -> DISPOSITION_UNPOWER
	* disposition(for transaction) > DISPOSITION_LEAVE
	* initialization(reconnect)   -> INITIALIZATION_RESET (warm reset)
	* IORequest	-> according to status[:protocol] for send, .new for recv
	

* Methods added to take blocks to provide a more rubyish interface:
	* Card.card {}, Context.context {} cf. File.open() {}
	*    also aliased as Card/Context.connect (...)
	* card.transaction

* Added tests and mock Card and Context to test without reader/inserted card
  (export TEST_NO_CARD=yes; rake test)

* Everything *should* be entirely compatible, could be used as a drop in replacement.
  Obviously, code written using this versions features wouldn't be backwards compatible. 


TODO 

* I'm not using ReaderStates, and I'm not entirely sure I understand the interface, 
  so I've left that untouched.

* Update the documentation in the README

* Provide some utility to map numeric constants to ruby symbols for easier 
  `puts` debugging ...

* I was having some issues with the windows version of the library, but still need to debug.

* provide compiled versions (and test on) Window
