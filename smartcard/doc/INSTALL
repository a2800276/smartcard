In a perfect world, installing 'smartcard' would be an easy 'gem install smartcard'.
However, interfacing with hardware is never that easy. 

Building the extension on a POSIX system
------------
You need to be able to build C code, and have the pcsclite library installed. 
Then follow the standard Ruby extension build process:
1. cd <smartcard_dir>\ext\smartcard_pcsc
2. ruby extconf.rb
3. make
4. make install

OSX
---
Install the Developer Tools.

Leopard: everything else is already in place.
Tiger: need someone to test whether the pcsclite library included here works.

Ubuntu
---
Install the following packages:
	buildessentials
	libccid
	libpcsclite
	libpcsclite-dev
You might want to install the following packages to check for your reader's PC/SC compatibility.
	pcscd
	pcsc-tools
	
Something else
---
Go to the MUSCLE page: http://www.linuxnet.com/software.html
You need to download the pcsclite middleware and a driver for your reader.
The ccid driver works with most readers out there (this software is tested on it).


Building the extension on Windows
------------

This is a reference stolen from a random website and adapted for this extension.
It reminds the developers how to build the Ruby extension. Most people should use
the pre-compiled gem. 

1. Download and install Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition (free) 
2. Download and install the Platform SDK (ISO Edition) from Microsoft. 
	(I installed none of the 64–bit stuff — mostly just the 32–bit Intel core SDK)
3. Edit $RUBY_HOME/lib/ruby/1.8/i386-mswin32/config.h and delete the “#error MSC version unmatch” line 
4. Click your way to: 
	Start
	All Programs
	Microsoft Platform SDK…
	Open Build Environment Window
	Windows XP 32–bit Build Environment
	Set Windows XP…(Retail) 
5. cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin" 
	The quotes are important. 
6. vcvars32.bat 
7. cd <smartcard_dir>\ext\smartcard_pcsc 
8. ruby extconf.rb
9. nmake
10.	mt.exe -manifest pcsc.so.manifest -outputresource:pcsc.so;2 
	Copy and paste the command above. You need it all from the 'mt' to the ';2' 
11. nmake install
