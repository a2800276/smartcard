SUMMARY

'smartcard' aims to become the de-facto support library for smart-card development on ruby.
At the moment, 'smartcard' offers a PC/SC binding that is working on ruby 1.8, under
linux, osx, and windows. Future plans include a high level abstraction for the PC/SC binding 
(and any other bindings people need), and an interface for Java cards.

DOCUMENTATION

The API is fully documented with RDoc. If you installed the 'smartcard' gem, you should be
