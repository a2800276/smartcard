+smartcard+ aims to become the standard support library for smart-card development on ruby.
Right now, the project offers a PC/SC binding that is working on ruby 1.8, under
Linux, OSX, and Windows. Future plans include a high level abstraction for the PC/SC binding 
(plus any other bindings people need), and an interface for Java cards.

= Installation

	gem install smartcard
Windows:: Select the <tt>win32</tt> gem.
OSX:: Install the Developer Tools to get +gcc+. Requires Tiger or Leopard.
UNIX:: You need a PC/SC provider. See the {BUILD file}[link://files/BUILD.html] for details. The file also contains package lists for popular distributions.

= Documentation

The documentation you see was generated with RDoc. If you install the +smartcard+ gem, you should be
able to use ri to see the documentation. If you're using the SVN version, you can <tt>rake doc</tt> to build
the HTML documentation yourself.

= License

+smartcard+ is released under the MIT license. This means you're free to do whatever you want
with it. However, it'd be nice to let the developers know if you plan to include this in a
distribution (bragging rights are always good). The {LICENSE file}[link://files/LICENSE.html]
has the license in legalese.

= Acknowledgements

+smartcard+ is developed by Victor Costan while working as a Research Assistant for MIT.
